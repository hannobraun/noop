	Collision response doesn't really fit in the Physics module. It should
	either have its own module or be part of the Collisions module.
2012-04-19:
	Currently, all collisions are completely elastic. It would look and feel a
	lot better, if they were somewhat inelastic. This requires damping in the
	collision response code to work correctly, which currently it doesn't.
2012-04-19:
	When colliding, objects should transmit some of their rotation.
2012-04-20:
	Instead of Loader loading the game, Loader should be used by the game to
	load stuff. Less "framework", more "library".
2012-04-23:
	Turns out the Velocity Verlet integrator in the Physics module isn't very
	good for orbital simulations. The integrator should be pluggable and several
	integrators (at least Velocity Verlet and Euler) should be provided.
2012-04-23:
	It should be possible to extend the draw functions in the Rendering module
	with new ones. There should also be more draw functions for different kinds
	of primitives (Tiny World War has a few of these that could be imported).
2012-04-23:
	Per-renderable render data should be supported. The current approach is good
	for render data that is re-used for many renderables (like images or
	collision geometry) but falls flat for a lot of other use cases.
2012-04-23:
	There should be a better system for input events. While the current approach
	works well for many kinds of game controls, a lot of UI stuff becomes
	tedious, since single events for key presses are often needed.
	Currently, the event API is converted into a poll API, which then has to be
	mis-used to get events out of again.
2012-04-23:
	The Entities module should initialize the components data structure
	automatically. Having to add empty maps for all types of components manually
	doesn't really serve any purpose.
2012-04-23:
	Using collisions detection requires a lot of glue code. This should be
	improved.
2012-04-23:
	Sometimes it is necessary to prevent the default behavior of input events
	using event.preventDefault(), for example to prevent accidental scrolling of
	the website. This should be supported by the Input module.
2012-04-23:
	Building UIs is very tedious. There should be some basic support for this.
	For an example use case, see Tiny World War.
2012-04-24:
	There should be an easy way (a shell script or something) to create a
	deployable page from game. Deployment should support deployment to a
	gh-pages branch on GitHub.
2012-04-26:
	The setTimeout fallback for requestAnimationFrame doesn't work
	(noop-skeleton). This functionality should really reside in a test-covered
	module in the framework.
