	When colliding, objects should transmit some of their rotation.

	There should be a better system for input events. While the current approach
	works well for many kinds of game controls, a lot of UI stuff becomes
	tedious, since single events for key presses are often needed.
	Currently, the event API is converted into a poll API, which then has to be
	mis-used to get events out of again.

	Building UIs is very tedious. There should be some basic support for this.
	For an example use case, see Tiny World War.
2012-04-24:
	There should be an easy way (a shell script or something) to create a
	deployable page from game. Deployment should support deployment to a
	gh-pages branch on GitHub.

	The setTimeout fallback for requestAnimationFrame doesn't work
	(noop-skeleton). This functionality should really reside in a test-covered
	module in the framework.

	Setting the damping factor in collision response to anything other than
	zero causes some strange behavior. This needs to be investigated.
