	When colliding, objects should transmit some of their rotation.
2012-04-23:
	Building UIs is very tedious. There should be some basic support for this.
	For an example use case, see Tiny World War.
2012-04-24:
	There should be an easy way (a shell script or something) to create a
	deployable page from game. Deployment should support deployment to a
	gh-pages branch on GitHub.
2012-04-26:
	Setting the damping factor in collision response to anything other than
	zero causes some strange behavior. This needs to be investigated.
2012-05-09:
	Change the project structure in noop-skeleton. The one I tried in Ludus
	seems to be a lot more clear.
2012-05-09:
	Port improvements from Ludus. These include (but might not be limited to):
	- Improvements in Input module.
	- Improvements in Rendering module.
	- New draw functions.
2012-05-09:
	There should be a nice error message, if the factory function for an entity
	can not be found.
2012-05-09:
	If a browser doesn't support canvas, there should be a message apoligizing
	and explaining the situation.
2012-05-09:
	Renderable creation should be easier and require less code.
	- There should be two factory functions, one which creates renderables that
	  reference a resource, another which creates renderables that contain the
	  resource.
	- The resource id or resource itself should be passed into the factory
	  function, so there is no need to modify the renderable afterwards.
2012-05-09:
	Renderable position and orientation should be handled differently:
	- They don't make sense for all kinds of renderables. Some renderables might
	  have different properties (e.g. for a line "start" and "end" make more
	  sense than "position" and "end"), others might represent a global effect.
	  This is an argument for folding them into the resource itself.
	- Renderables that only reference resources may still need position and
	  orientation.
	- Handling position and orientation leads to repetitive code in draw
	  functions. This and the previous point might be an argument to only have
	  them in referencing renderables and have the render function handle them.
2012-05-09:
	"load" should be remaned to "require", making it more compatible to CommonJS
	AMD and more familiar to people used to it.
2012-05-09:
	Text rendering should be more generic, supporting left, center and right
	alignments.
2012-05-09:
	Code using the math modules looks like shit. Simple things are twice as long
	as they have to be, complex things are completely unreadable. There has to
	be a way to make vector math with in-place updated more usable. If not, we
	should do some research into using "immutable" vectors. Maybe the effects on
	garbage collection are not as bad as I fear.
2012-05-09:
	Right now, there are different draw functions for stroke'd and fill'd
	primitives. Those should be consolidated. The matter of filling or stroking
	should be handled by a flag in the resource.
