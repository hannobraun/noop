# noop framework

## What is it?

Noop is a framework for HTML5 games that renders to a
[canvas 2d context](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/). It is written in
CoffeeScript but should be usable from JavaScript without any trouble.


## Who's using it?

It grew out of a real game project by the author which, at the time of writing,
is not released yet.


## Who's the author?

## What about the name?

Probably its most obvious characteristic is that the framework doesn't use any
object-oriented programming (oop) techniques. Non-oop, or noop for short,
describes this programming style and since I couldn't think of any good names, I
went with this one.

The name's also a play on the "no operation" instruction of CPUs, although
that's normally written "nop".


## Why another framework?

I have a lot of odd ideas about programming, so I decided to try some of them
out.


## Is it any good?

It's undocumented, incomplete, mostly unproven and lacks polish. Other than
that, yes.


## So how do I get started?

The quickest way is to clone the
[noop-skeleton](https://github.com/hbraun/noop-skeleton) repository and follow
the directions there.


## I'd like to talk about this.
